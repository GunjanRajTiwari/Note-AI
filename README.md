# AI_Powered_Note_Maker Ok 

This concept was inspired by our own experience with online education. Humans, on the whole,
have a limited attention span. For that reason, attending long lectures or reading long texts is
quite tough for us. Consequently, we may overlook something important when taking notes
during a long presentation. We all know that taking notes by hand is an excellent habit to have,
but the essential objective is to review the notes later. Notes help us consume a great amount of
information quickly and efficiently. Hence, we decided to integrate AI into our solution to make
this note-taking scenario easier.
There are two ways to summarize a text:
1. Extractive Summarization: Extractive summarization is the process of concatenating
extracts from a corpus into a summary. This method finds the most important details,
extracts them, then groups them together to provide a summary.
2. Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive summarization entails constructing new phrases
from data collected from a corpus. This method rewrites the entire content using internal
semantic representation, followed by the creation of a summary.

Our system uses both techniques to summarize a text. There are three input methods to the
system:
1. Text Input: The input text is used to generate key points and one-line headlines using
extractive summarization and also generate the abstractive summary. We expect the
formal content in the text input.
2. Upload / Record Audio: The user can either upload an audio file or directly record the
audio during a session. That audio is transcribed and then the summary is generated using
the abstractive summarization technique. We expect the informal content in the audio
input.
